Project developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science course in the second semester of the 2023/2024 academic year

Data Exploration and Enrichment for Supervised Classification

In this project, the goal was to predict whether a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) would survive or not, based on the clinical data provided.

We used a dataset with information from 165 patients, divided unequally into two subsets:

  - 70% of the data was used to train five machine learning models
  - 30% was reserved to evaluate the performance of the models on data never seen before.

Features

- Jupyter notebook containing:
 
    - Data cleaning, exploration, and enrichment
    Visualizations with detailed explanations
    Training and evaluation of classification models

- PowerPoint presentation with a summary of the project and main results

- ODT document with the final analysis and conclusions of the work

All files are available in this GitHub repository

Requirements

  - Python 3
  - Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Instructions for Use To ensure the notebook runs correctly, make sure the dataset file is in the same folder as the .ipynb file.
